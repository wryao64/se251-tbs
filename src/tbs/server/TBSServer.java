/**
 * Provides the interface to a server for a theatre booking system (TBS). The server manages acts held in theatres.
 * An act is put on by an artist (e.g. "Greta Van Fleet"), and has a duration.
 * An act has a series of performances (e.g., "Friday night at 6pm", "Saturday matinee at 2pm", 
 * and "Saturday night at 8pm")
 * Performances take place in a theatre.  
 * Tickets are issued for seats.
 * Seats in theatres are arranged as a square block, with as many seats in a row as there are rows. 
 * A seat is identified by the row number it is in and its position in the row. 
 * About half the seats are considered "premium" seating. These are the lowest numbered rows.
 * @version <font color=red>20180329. Note that further (and possibly more recent) updates are listed on the Canvas page for the assignmet.</font>
